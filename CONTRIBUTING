CONTRIBUTING TO NODEJS

Development discussion happens on the "nodejs-dev" mailing list.

   http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-dev

Before starting any major work, you may want to run your ideas past
the group so as to avoid wasting time and effort.

1. Clone the repository (working off your own fork is fine, too.)

   git clone http://github.com/ry/node.git

2. Make some changes.

3. Commit those changes with reasonably descriptive short messages.
   The first line of any commit message should be no longer than 50
   characters.

4. Make sure you're still in sync with the latest code.

   git pull --rebase http://github.com/ry/node.git master

5. Create patch file(s)

   git format-patch origin/master

   or if you are working on your own github clone, and have ry/node
   listed as a remote:

   git format-patch ry/master

   This will create a .patch file for every commit you added.

6. Send the patch files as attachments to <nodejs-dev@googlegroups.com>
   and <ry@tinyclouds.org>, along with brief description of the issue.
   Start the subject line with "[PATCH]".
