## Standard Modules

Node comes with a number of modules that are compiled in to the process,
most of which are documented below.  The most common way to use these modules
is with `require('name')` and then assigning the return value to a local
variable with the same name as the module.

Example:

    var util = require('util');

It is possible to extend node with other modules.  See `'Modules'`

## Modules

Node uses the CommonJS module system.

Node has a simple module loading system.  In Node, files and modules are in
one-to-one correspondence.  As an example, `foo.js` loads the module
`circle.js` in the same directory.

The contents of `foo.js`:

    var circle = require('./circle.js');
    console.log( 'The area of a circle of radius 4 is '
               + circle.area(4));

The contents of `circle.js`:

    var PI = Math.PI;

    exports.area = function (r) {
      return PI * r * r;
    };

    exports.circumference = function (r) {
      return 2 * PI * r;
    };

The module `circle.js` has exported the functions `area()` and
`circumference()`.  To export an object, add to the special `exports`
object.

Variables
local to the module will be private. In this example the variable `PI` is
private to `circle.js`.

### Core Modules

Node has several modules compiled into the binary.  These modules are
described in greater detail elsewhere in this documentation.

The core modules are defined in node's source in the `lib/` folder.

Core modules are always preferentially loaded if their identifier is
passed to `require()`.  For instance, `require('http')` will always
return the built in HTTP module, even if there is a file by that name.

### File Modules

If the exact filename is not found, then node will attempt to load the
required filename with the added extension of `.js`, and then `.node`.

`.js` files are interpreted as JavaScript text files, and `.node` files
are interpreted as compiled addon modules loaded with `dlopen`.

A module prefixed with `'/'` is an absolute path to the file.  For
example, `require('/home/marco/foo.js')` will load the file at
`/home/marco/foo.js`.

A module prefixed with `'./'` is relative to the file calling `require()`.
That is, `circle.js` must be in the same directory as `foo.js` for
`require('./circle')` to find it.

Without a leading '/' or './' to indicate a file, the module is either a
"core module" or is loaded from a `node_modules` folder.

### Loading from `node_modules` Folders

If the module identifier passed to `require()` is not a native module,
and does not begin with `'/'` or `'./'`, then node starts at the parent
directory of the current module, and adds `/node_modules`, and attempts
to load the module from that location.

If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so
on, until either the module is found, or the root of the tree is
reached.

For example, if the file at `'/home/ry/projects/foo.js'` called
`require('bar.js')`, then node would look in the following locations, in
this order:

* `/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/node_modules/bar.js`

This allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not
clash.

#### Optimizations to the `node_modules` Lookup Process

When there are many levels of nested dependencies, it is possible for
these file trees to get fairly long.  The following optimizations are thus
made to the process.

First, `/node_modules` is never appended to a folder already ending in
`/node_modules`.

Second, if the file calling `require()` is already inside a `node_modules`
heirarchy, then the top-most `node_modules` folder is treated as the
root of the search tree.

For example, if the file at
`'/home/ry/projects/foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz/quux.js'`
called `require('asdf.js')`, then node would search the following
locations:

* `/home/ry/projects/foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz/node_modules/asdf.js`
* `/home/ry/projects/foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/asdf.js`
* `/home/ry/projects/foo/node_modules/asdf.js`

### Folders as Modules

It is convenient to organize programs and libraries into self-contained
directories, and then provide a single entry point to that library.
There are three ways in which a folder may be passed to `require()` as
an argument.

The first is to create a `package.json` file in the root of the folder,
which specifies a `main` module.  An example package.json file might
look like this:

    { "name" : "some-library",
      "main" : "./lib/some-library.js" }

If this was in a folder at `./some-library`, then
`require('./some-library')` would attempt to load
`./some-library/lib/some-library.js`.

This is the extent of Node's awareness of package.json files.

If there is no package.json file present in the directory, then node
will attempt to load an `index.js` or `index.node` file out of that
directory.  For example, if there was no package.json file in the above
example, then `require('./some-library')` would attempt to load:

* `./some-library/index.js`
* `./some-library/index.node`

### Caching

Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded.  This means
(among other things) that every call to `require('foo')` will get
exactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file.

### All Together...

To get the exact filename that will be loaded when `require()` is called, use
the `require.resolve()` function.

Putting together all of the above, here is the high-level algorithm
in pseudocode of what require.resolve does:

    require(X)
    1. If X is a core module,
       a. return the core module
       b. STOP
    2. If X begins with `./` or `/`,
       a. LOAD_AS_FILE(Y + X)
       b. LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(Y + X)
    3. LOAD_NODE_MODULES(X, dirname(Y))
    4. THROW "not found"

    LOAD_AS_FILE(X)
    1. If X is a file, load X as JavaScript text.  STOP
    2. If X.js is a file, load X.js as JavaScript text.  STOP
    3. If X.node is a file, load X.node as binary addon.  STOP

    LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(X)
    1. If X/package.json is a file,
       a. Parse X/package.json, and look for "main" field.
       b. let M = X + (json main field)
       c. LOAD_AS_FILE(M)
    2. LOAD_AS_FILE(X/index)

    LOAD_NODE_MODULES(X, START)
    1. let DIRS=NODE_MODULES_PATHS(START)
    2. for each DIR in DIRS:
       a. LOAD_AS_FILE(DIR/X)
       b. LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(DIR/X)

    NODE_MODULES_PATHS(START)
    1. let PARTS = path split(START)
    2. let ROOT = index of first instance of "node_modules" in PARTS, or 0
    3. let I = count of PARTS - 1
    4. let DIRS = []
    5. while I > ROOT,
       a. if PARTS[I] = "node_modules" CONTINUE
       c. DIR = path join(PARTS[0 .. I] + "node_modules")
       b. DIRS = DIRS + DIR
    6. return DIRS
